      essayAuthor: "By: Jamie Rodriguez | Period 3",
      essayParagraph1:
        "Feedback is the cornerstone of effective learning. When teachers provide thoughtful, specific feedback, students gain a clearer understanding of their strengths and areas for growth. Research shows that quality feedback can improve student achievement by up to 30%.",
      essayParagraph2:
        "The most impactful feedback is timely and actionable. Students benefit most when they receive comments while the material is still fresh in their minds. This allows them to immediately apply suggestions and see the connection between effort and improvement.",
      essayParagraph3:
        "Great feedback goes beyond simple corrections. It celebrates what students do well, asks probing questions that encourage deeper thinking, and provides clear next steps for improvement. This balanced approach builds confidence while challenging students to reach higher.",
      essayParagraph4:
        "In conclusion, investing time in meaningful feedback transforms the learning experience and helps every student realize their full potential.",

Las investigaciones muestran que la retroalimentacion de calidad puede mejorar el rendimiento estudiantil hasta en un 30%.",

      essayParagraph1:
        "La retroaction est la pierre angulaire d'un apprentissage efficace. Lorsque les enseignants fournissent une retroaction reflechie et specifique, les eleves acquierent une comprehension plus claire de leurs forces et de leurs domaines de croissance. Les recherches montrent que la retroaction de qualite peut ameliorer les resultats des eleves jusqu'a 30%.",
      essayParagraph2:
        "La retroaction la plus percutante est opportune et actionnable. Les eleves beneficient le plus lorsqu'ils recoivent des commentaires alors que le materiel est encore frais dans leur esprit. Cela leur permet d'appliquer immediatement les suggestions et de voir le lien entre l'effort et l'amelioration.",
      essayParagraph3:
        "Une excellente retroaction va au-dela des simples corrections. Elle celebre ce que les eleves font bien, pose des questions approfondies qui encouragent une reflexion plus profonde et fournit des etapes claires pour s'ameliorer. Cette approche equilibree renforce la confiance tout en defiant les eleves d'aller plus loin.",
